What would make you say “Hi” right away? What would you want to see when you join? What would make you read the rules and get a good sense of your community’s mission?</p><h4>The Perfect Member Experience</h4><p>Let’s start from the beginning. What do you <strong>want</strong> your members to see first? </p><p>This is something we call <strong>Journey Mapping</strong>. Imagining what a new member goes through puts you in their shoes and helps you understand what they need to become an active member of your community.</p><p>Once you’ve been in their shoes, you can pave the path they’ll take into your community, as well as make sure you set the right tone and first impression.</p><p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Remember, not everyone is a Discord veteran! New users join every day, and your server may be the first one they’ve been to. </p><p>Creating an inclusive and not overly complicated onboarding flow will help everyone get involved, so think about creating spaces that are easy for new members to start chatting and aren’t overloaded.</p><h5><strong>Helping New Members Find Their Way</strong></h5><p>If you can get new members chatting in their first 15 minutes of landing in your server, you&#x27;re off to an excellent start. To help members to feel confident in where to go and how to navigate your server, it’s a good idea to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server#:~:text=Click%20on%20your%20server%20name,setting%20up%20your%20Community%20Server">Enable Community</a> to set up built-in membership screening and a Welcome Screen.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Use your Welcome Screen to highlight key channels to check out first and how to find key information. </strong>Include a combination of informative and engaging channels (like a channel directory) that allow new members to send their first message (like in an introductions channel).</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Membership screening requires new members to read through a customized set of server rules and confirm they agree before being allowed to chat.</strong> This works particularly well for medium to large servers as it requires little to no manual effort and allows you to state your community mission clearly and how members will be expected to behave.</li></ul><h5><strong>Sharing Your Community Mission</strong></h5><p>If you can have your mission in place from the get-go, it’ll become a vital tool for guiding your decision making and making sure community managers and members alike are headed towards a common goal.</p><p>Get started by putting together a concise purpose statement that encompasses:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Who</strong> you’re gathering</li><li><strong>What</strong> people should do </li><li><strong>Why</strong> this will bring value to you all</li></ul><p>Then, share it in a public channel for members to see as they join. </p><p>If members can feel assured their values align with the community’s mission and that they’re joining a like-minded group of people, they’ll be more likely to feel a sense of belonging.</p><h4><strong>Encourage Members to Contribute</strong></h4><p>Depending on your server&#x27;s purpose, set up a special intro channel to allow new members to share their stories.</p><p>This can encourage members to create strong bonds by getting them involved from the beginning. Asking random questions like their favorite ice cream flavor or their favorite song is a great ice breaker that sets your community apart and entices organic conversation between members. </p><p>It’s also a good idea to make sure you’re taking the time to respond to your new members’ messages and welcoming them into a server with a friendly, <strong>human </strong>response! </p><p>Remember, it can be daunting to jump straight in and start chatting with new people mid-conversation, so introducing some easier ways for new members to engage from the beginning will really help people get involved.</p><h5><strong>Lead by Example and Welcome New Members</strong></h5><p>As an admin, it&#x27;s up to you to set the standard as the model community member, as new members will look to you to gauge what to do and how to behave.</p><p>If you’re finding new members are joining your server without introducing themselves, set up a join log (via server settings) to help you keep track of members as they arrive. You can then tag them in an engaging welcome message, ask them a question (like where they’re from) or paste an introduction template. </p><p>Although this might feel a little manual or time-consuming to start with, if you can stick to it, these things will eventually become community habits that are adopted by all members. </p><h5><strong>Learn by Trial and Error</strong></h5><p>Onboarding takes time to find what works best for your community and size, and it can sometimes take a bit of trial and error.</p><p>For example, in the Pokemon GO Ottawa Community, the built-in membership screening feature is set up to make sure new members have read the rules. After confirming, they’re given access to only a few channels including a welcome channel, a channel for help, and another channel to become verified. The rest of the server is locked behind this role until they’re verified.  </p><p>While this is a slightly longer onboarding process than most servers, it helps prevent bots and spam as only people with a Pokémon GO account are able to verify. </p><p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> If you want to check on how you’ve set up your server for new members, you’ll have the ability to <em>View Server as…</em> a specific role. This feature reorganizes your server to show only what that role would see to provide a real-time look into what a new member experiences. </p><p>It’s also a good idea to keep an eye on your <a href="https://discord.com/community/understanding-server-insights">Server Insights</a> <a href="community-manage-engage.html#"></a><a href="community-manage-engage.html#"></a><a href="community-manage-engage.html#"></a>to see where new members are going and what’s working well for your new member onboarding. </p><p>Understanding a good onboarding experience is crucial to the success of a server.

A little effort every day, a little more every now and then, and a reliably thoughtful relationship with your moderators and members can encourage people to keep coming back. </p><p>Your goal is to find the tactics and rhythm that work best for your community.</p><h4><strong>Engagements, Big and Small</strong></h4><p>If you want your members to post regularly, you should try to give them a reason regularly. Find simple, sustainable ways to reach out maybe once or twice a week. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Engagement Questions: </strong>Start a conversation: <em>what’s your PC setup look like? Share pictures of your houseplants. </em>Taking part helps!</li><li><strong>Daily/Weekly Updates: </strong>Hosting a Stage Channel where you share what’s new doesn’t just give people a reason to pop in, it gives them something to look forward to.</li><li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Let your members regularly vote on what they want from you, from new content to new server channels.</li></ul><p>These daily efforts will pay off even more when they’re supplemented by bigger scheduled events. </p><p>The more regular or exclusive to your server a big-ticket engagement is, the more likely people will be to come back for it. Consider scheduling something exciting at least once a month.</p><p>Stage Events are excellent for more involved engagements: they let everyone participate in Q&amp;As, round tables, live performances, seminars and other big tickets without letting things get out of control.

To get the most out of your team…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Let your moderators know when you’ll have lulls or spikes in activity so that they can plan, adjust and facilitate engagement. </li><li><strong>Accept Help:</strong> If you can trust your moderators to host and even design events, you’ll be able to focus your own efforts even more. </li><li><strong>Use Server Insights: </strong>Giving your mod team the power to <a href="moderation/1500000179521-341%253A-Understanding-Your-Community-Through-Insights.html">analyze Server Insights</a> will help them understand and connect with the community.</li><li><strong>Know What Burnout Looks Like:</strong> Consistency is important, but so is taking a break. <a href="moderation/360058645534-311%253A-Understanding-and-Avoiding-Moderator-Burnout.html">Know when you, or your team, need some time off.</a></li></ul><h4><strong>Understand Your Limits and Priorities</strong></h4><p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but part of making your community happy is making sure <em>you’re </em>happy. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Trust Your Instincts: </strong>The community might suggest changes to your channels, rules, or schedule, but it’s your community too. Be understanding, but don’t be afraid to set boundaries.</li><li><strong>Get Ahead of Anxiety: </strong>Maybe you can’t keep up your schedule for a while. Maybe you just need a break. Consider letting people know so they understandd—and they won’t wonder where you went or whether you’re coming back.</li><li><strong>Know You’re Not Alone: </strong>Find people in your community you can trust.

You could even introduce a fun prize category like a <em>Community’s Choice</em> award. </li></ul><p>Here’s a great example from the Design Buddies Community!</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1090pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/62aa984eac82d5f59727a181_Grace.png" loading="lazy" alt="A server announcement from the Design Buddies Discord community. The post describes the event, how it works, the rules, and how to submit entries."/></div></figure><h4><strong>Voice Events</strong></h4><p>Your show-and-tells could also be hosted using a voice chat or stage channel to encourage more human interaction. </p><p>This could be a chance for the community to come together and showcase their work around a certain theme.</p><p>‍<strong>Tips for Hosting Voice Events With Your Community</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Set up an additional Text Channel on top of the voice channel as another way for members to participate, ask questions, or share work. </li><li>Use Discord’s Event feature to schedule your event beforehand and move channels to the top of the list during the event for more visibility!  </li><li>Encourage members to share their own event ideas or invite members to pitch their own community event to host. <strong><br/></strong></li></ul><p>For more on hosting voice events, check out <a href="https://discord.com/community/hosting-voice-events">this article</a>. </p><p>Again, the <a href="https://discord.gg/designbuddies">Design Buddies Community</a> does a great job of this, with clubs centered around interests (i.e. games and books) and led by community members. </p><p>These clubs meet regularly in voice chat to discuss specific topics and have their own text channel to share resources. To join a club, any member can assign themselves a role in our reaction roles channel to see the club’s text and voice channels.</p><h4><strong>Showcase Your Community’s Artwork In-Server</strong></h4><p>Allowing community members to create custom emojis and stickers is another great way to help drive engagement and build a sense of ownership with any contributing artists. </p><p>Additionally, your community’s artwork can be recognized and utilized in a load of other ways too. For example, you can set it as your server icon, include it on your invite splash page, or feature it in your server banner.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1090pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/62aa98a3fd164f4cf9a93226_Fluffle.png" loading="lazy" alt="A server announcement from the Design Buddies Community showing off new artwork from their members."/></div></figure><p>You could also feature a gallery page on your community’s website dedicated to showcasing community work like <a href="https://www.designbuddies.community/gallery">Fluffle’s Gallery</a>!</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1090pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/62aa994d4e29e2d82bb09655_Gallery.png" loading="lazy" alt="A selection of images depicting Fluffle, the Design Buddies Community&#x27;s rabbit mascot, drawn by their community members. "/></div></figure><p>Remember to get everyone’s permission and credit the artist for their hard work!</p><h4><strong>Asking For Server Feedback</strong></h4><p>This one is a little less fun, but introducing a channel where community members can give feedback and make suggestions can be a great way to keep up with your member’s ideas and organize their feedback into one place. </p><p>After an event or activity, take the time to check in with the community and learn about anything that could have been improved. </p><p><strong>Not everything you do will be a total success and that’s okay. </strong>It’s a process of trial and error with your community. But each time you can gather feedback and learn, you have a chance to improve. </p><p>Each community is different, and there is no right or wrong approach to co-creation. Some communities generate community artwork, some do quizzes, some co-host voice events…</p><p>Like we always say, this is your party. So do what you think is best for your community!</p><p>With thanks to <a href="https://www.grace-ling.com/">Grace Ling</a> for all their help in writing this article.</p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/turning-your-social-posts-into-community-activations.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6304155015bf051975bd445b_Onboarding%20New%20Members.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 44vw, (max-width: 1439px) 29vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6304155015bf051975bd445b_Onboarding%20New%20Members-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6304155015bf051975bd445b_Onboarding%20New%20Members-p-800.png 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6304155015bf051975bd445b_Onboarding%20New%20Members-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6304155015bf051975bd445b_Onboarding%20New%20Members.png 1180w" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">Turning Your Social Posts into Community Activations</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Engage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3>Turning Your Social Posts into Community Activations</h3><p>Do you already post content to Twitter, YouTube, and other social media sites that are relevant to your community?

Look for ways to spark active conversations.</li><li><strong>Keep an Eye on What Works:</strong> Some of your social media posts will resonate more on Discord than others. Don’t just repost everything: pay attention to what provokes engagement and lean into it.</li></ul><p>Nobody needs you to turn every social media post into a server activation. </p><p>But as long as you’re thoughtful about what you share, there’s no reason you can’t make your existing copy work for you and your community. </p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/using-roles-to-increase-engagement.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/623cd5bf13a2fe7185743915_Using%20Roles%20to%20Increase%20Community%20Engagement.svg" alt="" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">Using Roles to Increase Server Engagement</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Engage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Using Roles to Increase Community Engagement</strong></h3><p>They may not look like much more than a color or an icon... But when roles are used well, they can make users feel more invested in your community, help members engage with others, and even make moderation easier.</p><p>Making and assigning roles within your server is a fantastic way to encourage member engagement and improve your community health.  And because they’re highly customizable, they can be used for anything from simple hierarchy to XP-based leveling systems allowing you to better connect it to external sites like Twitch or YouTube.</p><h4><strong>Server Roles in Your Community </strong></h4><h5><strong>Keep Your Community Organized</strong></h5><p>You can make good use of server roles to give members access to private channels. </p><p>Doing this means you can easily keep certain topics or content completely private or only visible to certain members of your community. You can do everything from having a moderator-only channel to having a VIP-type room for subscribers.</p><p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> There are various integrations and bots that Discord supports to link your server to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212112068-Twitch-Integration-FAQ">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215162978-Youtube-Channel-Memberships-Integration-FAQ">YouTube</a>, or <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/213552323-How-to-connect-Discord-to-Patreon-Creator-">Patreon</a> to automatically assign subscriber roles to supporters on other platforms. Other uses include...</p><ul role="list"><li>Subscriber-only channels</li><li>Voice channels for supporters</li><li>Giveaways for specific groups, like monthly Discord boosters or active chatters</li></ul><h5><strong>Make Roles Just for Fun</strong></h5><p>Everybody loves leveling up their XP, right?</p><p>Many Discord servers use bots to run XP-based leveling systems that encourage user engagement. The more a member engages in your community, the more XP they get and the more they level up to new roles.</p><p>It is worth noting that XP points and leaderboards may not be the best fit for all communities. Ultimately it’s up to you to decide how to encourage the right behavior and avoid falling into forced engagement or spam traps.</p><p>On the other hand, some community admins will manually reward people with additional roles or permanent titles for doing certain things. For example... </p><ul role="list"><li>Temporary roles for active chatters, contributors</li><li>Permanent roles unlocked via loyalty points on Discord or Twitch</li><li>Unique roles for contest winners to display</li><li>Opt-in roles for notifications about community events</li><li>Looking-for-group style gaming roles</li></ul><p>These types of roles are all effective ways of rewarding users with something that’s ultimately free to provide and encouraging them to interact with each other.</p><h5><strong>Self-Assigning Role Bots</strong></h5><p>Letting your users express themselves is a great way to drive engagement. That’s why self-assigning role bots are so useful.</p><p>They let your community members declare their interests, but they also help community members spot other like-minded folks and make friends with them.</p><p>If this sounds like something that would work for your server, there are numerous bots available for Discord servers that allow users to simply ‘react’ to a message that lists the various roles available. The bot will then automatically assign or unassign them! This can be used for...<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>Favorite games to help match you with other players</li><li>Hobbies to unlock additional relevant channels</li><li>Instrument you play for collaborating on music</li></ul><p>You can also use these roles to ping different groups of members by mentioning these roles in a message or announcement.</p><h3><strong>TLDR; Help People Find Their People</strong></h3><p>Communities grow and bond because members find hobbies and interests in common. There’s a much bigger chance of this happening if your community can simply click profiles and see someone’s interests. </p><p>In fact, it’s not unlike joining a book club or realizing you go to the same hobby group as someone you’ve seen around a few times. That’s why roles are one of your best tools for getting community members to engage with one another.</p><p><strong>With thanks to Alasdair for all their help in writing this article.</strong></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/hosting-voice-events.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/623cd797769c74e20c6eabaf_Hosting%20Voice%20Events.svg" alt="" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">Hosting Voice Events with Stage &amp; Voice Channels</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Engage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Why Host Events on Discord?</strong></h3><p>Events are a great, fun way to engage your community.

Once you’ve set an Event, it’ll appear at the top of your server and your members can reserve their digital seat by marking their interest.</p><p><strong>Come showtime, your community members will be prompted to join the Event!</strong></p><p><strong>Top Tip: </strong>Consider creating an opt-in Events role too! Giving your would-be attendees a nudge in your community&#x27;s Announcement Channel can help boost awareness and activity in events.</p><p>Announcement Channels let users follow a channel in their own private server and see every message published in that channel even while they&#x27;re away. An announcement can help members stay up to date on future events and plans outside of the Events feature, so make sure you have Community on. </p><h4><strong>Moderating Your Discord Voice Events</strong></h4><p>The key to a great event lies in two things: planning and moderating. When you get together with your moderator or event team to plan out an event, answer key questions like... </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>How do we manage unruly behavior?</strong> Timing out, banning, or removing users can all be valid moderation actions to keep the integrity of an event intact.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>How do we plan on efficiently hosting our event? </strong>Dates, times, prizes, and any other background information should be communicated with your team in advance. Put the details in writing in a clear, easily accessible place for everyone to see. </li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Who will be on hand to moderate during the event? </strong>If you’re busy hosting, it&#x27;s important to select moderators before the event who can focus on safety and organization while the event takes place. </li></ul><p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with planning in advance. In fact, setting a routine can help make future events easier to plan, run, and manage. </p><p>GLHF, admins.

Within each Stage channel, a member can be a Stage moderator, a Speaker, or listen from the audience, to learn more about how Stage Channels work use this guide <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005513722-Stage-Channels-FAQ">here</a>!</p><p>We’re excited to share that Stage Channels now has video and screen share! Make your Stage events even more fun by hosting video or screen share for up to 50 people for free. For communities who need to host larger get togethers and use video we now have the ability to extend up to 300 people through Boosting!<br/>‍<br/>The possibilities are endless…so where do you begin?  First, consider what makes your community stay active and engaged. Here are some examples of what your server might want from Stages and how you can give it to them.</p><h4>Conversations</h4><ul role="list"><li><strong>Interviews and AMAs:</strong> Give your members a chance to ask their favorite creators, musicians, and community figures all their burning questions in an organized format.</li><li><strong>Hobby Roundtables: </strong>While free-for-all discussions are fun, sometimes it’s nice to inject a little focus and dignity into the conversation.</li><li><strong>Town Halls:</strong> Got some announcements or news to share with your community? Don’t just drop it on them and walk away: <strong>let them stand up and make their own voices heard.</strong></li></ul><h4>Performances</h4><ul role="list"><li><strong>Seminars and Panels: </strong>Want to teach a skill or topic to your community? Stages give the floor to whomever’s dropping knowledge while still leaving room for Q&amp;A.</li><li><strong>Live Shows: </strong>If you do a podcast, an actual play, or some other content where audio features heavily, try using a Stage to host a live show for your server. Not only will it be a fun change of pace, it’ll give fans a huge incentive to join your community.</li><li><strong>Open Mic:</strong> It’s hard to overstate the value of a karaoke night, stand-up contest, or member-run concert in making your server feel like an active community. Music bots are a great way to add sound effects and backing tracks!</li></ul><h4>Personal Connection</h4><ul role="list"><li><strong>Morning Coffee: </strong>A five-minute Stage event as part of your morning routine is one way to make your server a natural, daily part of people’s lives.</li><li><strong>Weekly Chats: </strong>You may not have enough news to justify a Town Hall, but a fifteen minute weekly chat will emphasize how important your community is to you.</li><li><strong>Diary Sessions: </strong>If you really want to show off a personal side, you might pop in on a regular basis to share stories from your own life.</li></ul><p>For those of you who need to host larger video get-togethers, you can now welcome many more through Boosting. Here is how it works; </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>No Boosts -&gt; 1-50 audience size</strong></li><li><strong>Level 2 Boost -&gt; 51-150 audience size</strong></li><li><strong>Level 3 Boost -&gt; 151-300 audience size</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Stage channels are only available within Community servers.</strong></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/understanding-server-insights.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/623cd69a98d93c4da25211cb_Growing%20your%20Community%20through%20Server%20Insights.svg" alt="" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">Understanding Server Insights</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Engage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3>Getting to Know Your Server With Server Insights</h3><h4><strong>Why Is Engagement Important?</strong></h4><p>Even servers with thousands of members have periods when things go a little quiet. So if things have started to quiet down in your community, don’t worry. Discord has a tool to help you get things sparking again: <strong>Server Insights</strong>.</p><p>Server Insights can help you measure engagement, the life blood of your community. When your members interact with announcements, join events, or scream at your dad jokes in <em>#general</em>, that&#x27;s engagement—it means your members are finding value and connection in your community. </p><p>Did you know? Engagement is so important that metrics like engagement and retention are also one of the things we’ll look at when accepting <a href="https://discord.com/partners">Discord Partner applications.</a></p><h4>‍<strong>What Can You Learn From Server Insights?<br/></strong></h4><p>Server Insights are a great piece of feedback once you know how to break them down. At a glance, you’ll be able to see overall and weekly updates on things like visitors, communicators, and new member retention. </p><p>Here&#x27;s a quick guide to some of the terminology!</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Visitors: </strong>A visitor is any member who has clicked on a channel in the server. This analytic is not affected by the member talking in a channel or not, it just logs if a member clicked on the server to check up on a channel.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Communicators: </strong>Communicators are a server member that has talked on the server. This could be either posting in a Text Channel or chatting in a Voice Channel.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>New Member Retention:</strong> This shows the percentage of new members that return to your server after a week. The percentage shows how well your server is at making sure that members come back again and again.</li></ul><h4><strong>Aim for a Healthy Ratio of Visitors and Communicators </strong></h4><p>When you visit Server Insights, you’ll be able to see your server’s numbers plotted against Discord&#x27;s benchmark of 30% communicators as a healthy goal. </p><p>If you can, you should aim for roughly 50% of your members to be <em>visiting</em>, with 50% of those visitors communicating and getting involved. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/6245e1b5f6beb15ce80b2c17_7HQbfYJpcnbj_oUNFhy7iOkt32z_n5l3LfKwGbUcfXWTdsS_Mrkxf7OGpD2mR6CEovyUX5wTVqvI4hPdoIqBCkRZ44o2zeHyWvGKspn7dZlbI7-sRBuTKPUTStmZrLXimQE13ehc.png" alt=""/></div></figure><p>Eager to see the impact of your uptick in talent shows on your community? You can keep track of your server’s growth and activity as you compare your server insights week on week. </p><h4><strong>Had a Dip? Don’t Panic!</strong></h4><p>If you have a week or two that dips a little, don’t panic! It may just be that external factors influence your members, especially if things like school are picking up or the holidays have come around.</p><p><strong>It’s important to remember that everyone has their own lives and activity will sometimes dip because of this. That’s okay. </strong></p><p>Checking in on your Server Insights can help you to determine if it was just a slow week or if there are repeated patterns you need to start looking into.</p><h3><strong>Tips for Creating an Environment for Engagement</strong></h3><h4><strong>Make a Good First Impression<br/></strong></h4><p>Is the server messy? Are there unused channels that bury others? Does a bot cause issues rather than solve problems? Does the server look nice or is it all a bit busy? </p><p>Cutting down excess stuff or fixing up issues can make your server an easier space to use and give your members more confidence in navigating various channels. This can also help new members stick around for longer and ultimately increase retention too!</p><p><strong>Top Tip: </strong>You can see what new members click on and how they behave afterwards by heading to the “Welcome Section” of your server insights. If you’re finding that not many new members are clicking or sending a message, think about switching up your welcome text or highlighting different channels. <strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>Maintaining Server Engagement<br/></strong></h4><p>The “Engage” section of your server insights is your engagement-generating best friend. At a glance, you’ll be able to see which channel is generating the most activity and where you could be sparking more conversation. <br/>If your community loves gaming, you could go into a quiet channel and bring up a leading question like “What was your favorite Pokémon as a kid?” to take a trip down memory lane together. </p><p>This way, you&#x27;re inviting other people into a conversation while bypassing awkward small talk.</p><p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Having too many channels can spread the conversation too thin and generally lead to lower engagement across the board. Use your Server Insights to order your channels by <em>Readers,</em> <em>Chatters,</em> and <em>Messages</em>—this will show you which channels can be deleted or archived based on how often your members interact with it! <strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>Use Voice Channels Effectively<br/></strong></h4><p>In Server Insights, you can see your server’s speaking minutes and which Voice Channels your members use the most. You can use this to track your success when using VCs to hang out in or host events.  </p><p>Even just hanging out in voice and chatting to your members (or welcoming newcomers as they arrive) is a quick, effective way to drive engagement. You can even teach new members about your Voice Channels and how they work. </p><p>Getting into the habit of jumping into voice allows you to bond, create inside jokes, or be on hand to support when problems arise too.</p><h4><strong>Measuring Success Through Community Events</strong></h4><p>Hosting events is another great way to grow and measure engagement. </p><p>Scheduling specific events around your server creates a space for your members to bond over their shared interests and create deeper connections.</p><p><strong>Here’s a Few Ideas We’ve Seen (And Loved)!</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>If your community loves comics, why not schedule a webtoon reading for everyone to do together?</li><li>If your community supports content creators, consider a day where people can showcase their work or teach a new skill?</li><li>If your community adores fashion, what about a wait-together for your favorite designer&#x27;s new collection? </li></ul><p>Remember, if people spend time making friends in your community, they&#x27;re more likely going to stay to hang out and build those connections. </p><p>By using the “Growth and Activation” section of your server insights, you’ll be able to see if members join the community specifically for an event and how many new members retain the next week. This can help you see what works and double down on it.</p><p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> An event-dedicated Text Channel can help new members to engage quickly and encourage conversation long after the event to help new members stick around.</p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/community-management-the-basics.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/623cd6d1934b05b9fc600c63_Community%20Management.svg" alt="" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">The Basics of a Safe, Active Server</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Manage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Community Management: The Basics</strong></h3><p>As an admin, you’ll need to wear many different hats to build and manage a thriving, healthy community.</p><p>In fact, it can be a full-time role at companies like Discord. So, let’s learn a little about a skill commonly known as <strong>community management</strong>.</p><p>Luckily, it’s easier than it sounds if you focus on the mantra of all great Community Managers:<br/></p><ul role="list"><li>Am I setting a good example?</li><li>Do I know what my community needs?</li><li>Do members feel included and that they belong?</li></ul><p>Here are some tips to make sure you’re the best community manager that you can be for your members.</p><h4><strong>Setting Expectations and Leading by Example</strong></h4><p>The first thing you’ll want to do as an admin is to set good expectations for your community. Having a clear mission or purpose for your community is often the first step. Ask yourself:</p><ul role="list"><li>Who are you gathering and what brings you all together? </li><li>What do you want to achieve with this community? </li><li>How are you going to do this? </li></ul><p>Once you have a clear purpose in mind, it’s a good idea to share it with all of your community so they join in and share it with others. </p><p>Your community members will be looking to you for what to do and how to behave. Getting involved in conversations and posting content that encourages a positive environment that supports your mission are two great (and easy) ways to lead by example.</p><p>Likewise, you’ll want to prevent any conversations that have the reverse effect. If hateful or otherwise harmful content and behaviors aren’t discouraged, users may be confused about your community’s purpose or believe that this is acceptable. <strong>It is not.</strong> </p><p>People are always more likely to engage and find community in a space where they feel comfortable, safe, and advocated for. </p><p>Don’t be afraid to put your foot down on harmful conduct. Remember, you’re setting the example—encourage the kind of community where anyone can belong and your members will follow. </p><h4><strong>Get To Know Your People</strong></h4><p>You want your community to know that you’re not some magical being, but a human being just like them. So be present and accessible. Have real, genuine conversations with your community and be responsive to questions they may have. This means responding to feedback, asking questions, and jumping in voice channels when your members need support. </p><p>Wondering how to give your members what they want? The only way you can balance your purpose with member needs is by knowing what your members’ needs are. This means speaking with your members and getting to know them so that you understand what they need, what they want from your community, and how you can support them. </p><p>Getting a good feel for your community’s motivations and interests also helps you really find out what kind of content is going to be a good fit. Do they want to show off fan art they’ve created for your content? Discuss your super-cool new game that just came out? Reach out to members 1-to-1 or ask for feedback in small groups. Encourage positive content and let the creativity flow! </p><h4>Building Flywheels</h4><p>By getting to know your community, you’ll be able to develop a strong bond with them. Once your server has become more established, your community may start to take on some of the responsibilities and routines you’ve set in those early days.</p><p><strong>This is called creating flywheels.</strong> For example…</p><ul role="list"><li>You may manually welcome each new member as they join in the beginning, but soon your members welcome others the same way.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Your community regulars lend a helping hand to new member in need while you’re away!</li></ul><p>Remember, this is a give and take relationship. If you see someone taking the initiative to help out, thank them and gently guide them as needed.</p><h3>‍<strong>How to Maintain a Healthy Community</strong></h3><p>Now you’ve created an amazing community and got to know them, how do you <em>maintain</em> this amazing environment? </p><p>Really, the answer is the same as it’s always been: making sure that you’re fostering a sense of belonging and making sure new members feel at home straight away. </p><p>But as you grow, you’ll need to scale your approach. For example, making sure that every new member is welcomed in a way that makes them feel included is particularly important. An easy way to help people feel included is to introduce personal roles, such as pronoun roles, or allow people to self-select their interests. </p><p><strong>You also want to make sure that your members feel heard—especially as your community grows. </strong></p><p>Holding regular events and talking to your community is great, but creating dedicated spaces for server members to ask questions and give feedback directly will also make a huge difference. </p><p>Ensure that your community members know they can talk to you about things they feel could be improved about your server and its environment. Even make time for those early members who helped you make the community what it is today! </p><p>If you’re continuing to talk with your members, staying up to date with their needs, and keeping your community engaged, <strong>you’re doing it right.</strong> You’re well on your way to managing a healthy and successful server environment.</p><p><strong>With thanks to joe for all their help in writing this article.</strong></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="item-content-wrapper w-dyn-item"><a data-w-id="03358246-9cac-524d-9c3a-2e0bc066f7e3" href="community/establishing-trust-with-connections-connection-details-and-linked-roles.html" class="link-card w-inline-block"><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/623b578041aa1f5fc6e3adc2/639752c1cb940a795f15f472_COMM_PortalHeaders_Manage_v2.png" alt="" class="image-safeties"/><div class="padding-20px"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 size-small community card-title">Establishing Trust with Social Media Connections and Roles</h2><div class="hidden"><div class="card-category">Manage</div></div></a><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><p>Would your community members like to know more about who they’re talking to?

Anything specific they want?</li><li><strong>Future - </strong>What would they like to see added, changed, removed, or improved?</li></ul><p>When you’ve collected a survey, make sure you share the results with admins helping run your server. If you decide to follow up with some feedback, make a note of what it is: your community will be much more likely to give useful answers and thoughtful feedback if they notice it’s having an impact on the server.</p><p>If you want to offer members more concrete incentives to answer, you’ll want to avoid any rewards that are too good to pass up—otherwise, you’ll get compelled answers that aren’t as sincere or useful. You might consider giving respondents a special role: not only is it a visible badge of participation, you can use it to easily mention and thank everyone once you’ve got your replies collected. You can even create an exclusive, hidden channel for their role, offering you a great place to ask your community off-the cuff questions.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="padding-40px
